Hi! Iâ€™m the founder of Conviction, an early stage venture capital firm. Iâ€™m interested in technology companies that improve the way we work, create and collaborate. Iâ€™m excited about AI-native software. I work closely with startups on whatever moves the needle to help them achieve and expand their ambitions, without losing their souls.

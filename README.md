Hi! I’m the founder of Conviction, an early stage venture capital firm. I’m interested in technology companies that improve the way we work, create and collaborate. I’m excited about AI-native software. I work closely with startups on whatever moves the needle to help them achieve and expand their ambitions, without losing their souls.
